Use Case:
Bobby sits at a computer and receives an email from a client.  He opens the software program PotteryDirectory.  When the 
program opens a GUI is generated.  He records how he received an order, the date, the clients name, clients address, 
their phone, email, payment information, the due date, he also types in what the client wants.  He saves this information 
and creates the item. Once it is created, he finds the client's information and he generates a shipping label, puts it on 
the box and sends it recording the ship date. 


User stories:
As an owner, I can store any customer information independently with the order so that I can reuse the information for 
the next order
